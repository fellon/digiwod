    <p>This will include what ever we want here. This will be the main body of the Pages. So all data will go in here. This will make everything look nice and follow one central theme. </p>
    <p>All good so far. Notice I have just dumped all this here for a wierd layout.<br>
      I will draw up some sketches tonight, and then scan them in and post those from links here or something.<br>
    </p>
    <p>We also need to decide on a color scheme. Just a note. I fucking hate black. Ohh vampires we need black and red. Or neon green for some reason.. No people. Be origonal. We are not a bunch of gothy little kids here. We can come up with real color schemes if we just apply ourselves. I love greys. I was personaly thinking a little darker greys then the current skin of the website, with a nice dark green in place of the blue.. One of those greens that makes you think thick swamp fog. I cant thing of it right now.But it is not Forest Green. Info please... The grey could be near charcoal grey... Nasty dark, but not black.</p>
